 * silently booking a ₹0 trip. Dates are epoch millis because that's what the Material date picker
 * hands back; they're only formatted to `yyyy-MM-dd` at the wire boundary in [toFormFields].
 *
 * The screenshot is held as a **URI string** rather than an `android.net.Uri` for the same reason the
 * rest of this file avoids Android types: [validate] has to be unit-testable, and the project has only
 * JUnit on the test classpath — no Robolectric. The bytes are read at the repository boundary.
 *
 * Note there is no `dueAmount` field. The backend recalculates due from total minus paid on save (and
 * recalculates paid itself from *verified* payments), so an editable due here would be a number the
 * agent could change and the server would ignore. It's derived for display via [impliedDueAmount].
